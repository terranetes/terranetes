## Example Terraform

This can be used with above object to create a 2 node cluster based on the OpenStack Provider (LBaaSv2 required, flip `loadbalancer.enable` to `false` if unavailable)

```
module "k8s" {
  source = "./core/kubernetes"
  k8s    = "${var.k8s}"
}

module "openstack" {
  source   = "./providers/openstack"
  k8s      = "${module.k8s.k8s}"
  ignition = "${module.k8s.ignition}"
  admin    = "${module.k8s.admin}"
}

output "k8s" {
  value = "${module.openstack.k8s}"
}

output "admin" {
  value = "${jsonencode(module.openstack.admin)}"
}
```
